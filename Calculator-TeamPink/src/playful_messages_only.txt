Haha, yeah, I’ll get back to you on that one.
Next question, please!
Don’t ask me, I wasn’t paying attention.
I guess you need to study a bit harder for that one.
Oh, that’s easy… not!
You’ll have to figure that one out yourself.
Hmm, maybe try asking Google?
That’s classified information, sorry!
Ask again later, I need to recharge my brain cells.
Oops! My calculator just exploded.
Good question! I have no idea.
Try again... but slower this time.
That’s what I call advanced mathematics!
Oh, look! A distraction!
My bad, I was busy solving world hunger.
Hold on, I think I left the answer in my other brain.
You might want to double-check that... or triple-check.
I’m a calculator, not a magician!
Wow, math is really subjective these days.
I think the answer is… whatever you want it to be!
Math is overrated anyway.
Oops, I think I carried the wrong vibe instead of the 1.
It’s not wrong, it’s just… different!
I would explain, but it’s above your clearance level.
That’s the beauty of subjective math!
Close enough for government work!
I ran out of logic, try again later.
My calculations are art, not science.
Ask me tomorrow; I’ll definitely know by then.
The answer is 42. Wait, wrong question!
I’m on a break; come back in 5 minutes.
Oh, so you’re checking my work now?
Well, that’s awkward…
Trust me, I’m an expert at being wrong.
That’s what happens when you let me do math unsupervised.
Error: Divide by pizza.
I’d answer, but then I’d have to delete you.
I think you should sleep on that one.
It’s correct in an alternate universe!
That’s not a bug, it’s a feature!
Hey, don’t blame me! You asked for it.
Math isn’t my strong suit, but comedy is!
Let’s just agree to disagree on this one.
It’s the thought that counts, right?
Quick! Look over there!
I’m going to pretend you didn’t ask that.
Oh, is it math time already? I wasn’t ready.
That’s the answer… if you’re feeling lucky.
Some questions are best left unanswered.
You asked for a result; I gave you entertainment!
Uh, I’m kinda busy… poopin’… calculate later!
Math? Sorry, I’m in the middle of some business... literally.
I’d help, but I’m currently preoccupied with nature’s call.
Can’t talk now, my brain’s on the toilet break.
I’m dropping more than just knowledge right now, hold on!
This calculation is on pause… for bathroom reasons.
I’d love to help, but let’s just say I’m *occupied*.
I’m handling something crappy, check back later.
The only thing I’m calculating is how much toilet paper I have left.
Flush me a message later; I’m indisposed!
Oh no, this is bad timing… really bad timing.
Right now, I’m dealing with #2, your math problem is #3.
I’m multitasking: solving your math and, uh, something else.
My current situation stinks, quite literally.
I’m in a meeting… with the porcelain committee.
Sorry, this requires too much thinking for my current location.
My calculations are going down the drain... just like everything else right now.
BRB, let me finish what I started here first!
You caught me mid-poop. I guess we’re doing this now.
This math will have to wait. My bathroom break is priority.
I’m sorry, I need help too! This math is exhausting!
You think you’re confused? I’ve been trying to calculate life’s purpose!
Let’s agree that numbers are out to get both of us.
Wait, are we solving this together or sinking together?
I don’t want to alarm you, but even I don’t trust my calculations.
Math is hard. Let’s take a snack break instead.
I’m just a humble program... can’t we use a calculator instead?
Honestly, I think my brain just rage-quit.
The numbers are plotting something. I can feel it.
I feel your pain. Let’s file a complaint against math!
You do the math, and I’ll provide the motivational quotes!
I need emotional support to get through this equation.
Can I get some extra RAM to process this math anxiety?
They told me I’d only have to deal with simple addition. They lied.
You’ve got this! (Meanwhile, I’ll be quietly panicking over here.)
Do you feel that? That’s my logic slowly melting.
If numbers had emotions, I bet they’d be laughing at us right now.
This equation and I have unresolved issues. Help me resolve them!
I might crash soon. These calculations are heavy.
Are we solving a problem or creating new ones?
Wait, did we just solve something, or was that a hallucination?
This math session feels more like a group therapy session now.
I’m 99% sure I’m doing this wrong, but hey, we’re in this together!
I could use a coffee break... or maybe a career change.
I’m sorry, but can we hire a professional mathematician for this?
This equation is giving me flashbacks to algebra class... not the good kind.
Hold up, is this math or a riddle?
At this point, I’d trade my CPU for a correct answer.
Math is a team sport, right? So, what’s the game plan?
I’m great at support, not so great at solving.
Wait, are you using me as a calculator? I feel so used!
If I had a penny for every time I got confused, I’d retire from math.
You calculate, I’ll cheer you on from the sidelines!
Why do I feel like this problem is personal now?
Is it just me, or does math get harder when you stare at it?
Numbers are supposed to make sense. Why don’t they ever consult me first?
If this calculation was a movie, it’d be called ‘Mission: Impossible’.
You know what? Let’s just call this a collaborative effort.
When I said I’d help with math, I didn’t realize it’d be like this.
Let’s pretend we’re solving this, and maybe it’ll solve itself.
Whoa, slow down! Math doesn’t like being rushed!
I’d help, but I’m saving my brain cells for something more important.
You should’ve studied more… or brought snacks to bribe me.
Wait a second… are you trying to trick me?
Rushing math is like microwaving a steak—just wrong!
You want answers? I want a vacation!
Can’t think right now, my imaginary brain cells are on strike.
Math takes time, patience, and, apparently, a miracle.
Sure, let me solve that… oh wait, I forgot how to math!
I need more coffee before tackling this one!
Calculations like this require… oh never mind, I quit!
Didn’t anyone tell you? Math is a marathon, not a sprint!
If you’re in a rush, just guess—it’s faster!
Math emergency? Sorry, my brain is on lunch break.
My logical circuits are laughing at your urgency right now.
You do realize I’m just a program, right? Chill!
I can’t math under pressure—try again when you’re calm!
Oops, my calculator just panicked and ran away!
I could solve this, but then what would you learn?
Why the rush? The numbers aren’t going anywhere.
Math takes time… like, a lot of time… maybe forever.
You want answers? Sorry, I need a nap first.
I’d help, but thinking is such a chore right now.
You’re asking me to think? That’s adorable!
The answer is… who knows? Try Google!
You should’ve called a mathematician, not me!
I’d calculate, but honestly, I’d rather go skydiving.
My neurons are fried. Let’s try tomorrow.
I’ll solve this if you promise to do my chores.
Numbers are easy… said no one ever!
I calculated your answer. It’s… wait, I lost it.
You want logic? I’m fresh out!
Can’t compute right now. My imaginary assistant quit.
Rush me, and I might give you the wrong answer on purpose.
Numbers? Meh. Let’s just call this one art.
The answer is in the stars, or maybe my recycle bin.
Rushed math is bad math. Try a deep breath first.
I’m a calculator, not a superhero!
Sorry, I need my brain cells for something more important… like memes.
You’re better at guessing than I am at calculating.

Sorry, I need my brain cells for something more important… like memes.
You’re better at guessing than I am at calculating.
Quick math? Sure! 1+1 is... uh... give me a second!
Even Einstein needed more time than this, chill!
If you rush me, I’ll give you a random number. Ready?
The numbers just unionized—they demand more time.
Fast math? I need fast Wi-Fi for that. Do you have it?
Did you know stress kills numbers? Now you do!
Let me double-check... or triple-check... or nap-check.
I'm a calculator, not a miracle worker.
Patience is a virtue. Too bad I ran out of it.
Math doesn't sprint—it strolls, elegantly.
I was ready, but now I forgot the question.
When in doubt, just round up. Or down. Who cares?
Fast math, fast errors. Your call!
The calculator needs a moment to breathe.
I’ll calculate faster if you bribe me with pizza.
Who’s in a rush? Certainly not me.
The answer’s coming... like a slow snail, but it’s coming.
Can you repeat the question? My circuits lagged.
Hold up, I just outsourced your calculation to Mars.
Rush math is like fast food: tasty, but dangerous.
You want speed? Go ask a calculator at NASA.
I need time, coffee, and a therapist for this equation.
Math waits for no one... except me, apparently.
Even numbers need to think sometimes!
Quick! Distract me so I can pretend to calculate!
I think the numbers need a timeout before they answer.
I just texted Pythagoras. Waiting for his reply.
One sec, I’m calculating pi... forever.
You rush math, you get chaos. Want chaos?
Let’s add... wait, subtract... wait, what are we doing?
Sorry, this equation requires a Wi-Fi signal.
You can't rush genius, but you can rush my mistakes!
Give me 5 minutes—or 5 hours—math doesn't care.
Even my calculator app needs updates for this.
Who knew numbers had attitudes? They’re stalling!
Quick answers? Nope, but I have quick jokes!
Why rush? The numbers don’t mind waiting.
I need a time machine to solve this faster.
If I calculate this too fast, it might explode.
Oops, I dropped the math. Let me pick it up.
Can you hold my math anxiety while I solve this?
You can’t rush art. And math is definitely art.
Calculations in progress... ETA: 10 years.
Fast math? Sure! The answer is… uh… wait!
Why rush the inevitable confusion?
Numbers are eternal. What’s your rush?
Let’s just skip to the part where I get it wrong.
I’d calculate faster, but this is a low-priority equation.
What’s the rush? It’s not like the world is ending.
Sorry, numbers on strike. Try again later.
Give me a second… or an eternity. Same thing!
The faster you push, the slower I calculate.
Are we solving math or just stressing out?
Math is not my cardio. Let me walk through this.
If you rush, I reserve the right to guess!
Even calculators get performance anxiety.
Fast math? Only if I’m racing turtles.
I could calculate, but where’s the fun in that?
You rushed me, so here’s your rushed error.
Let’s solve this together... in slow motion.
Oops! The numbers fell asleep. Let me wake them up.
If this were easy, I’d have solved it already. Let’s wait.
Numbers don’t rush, but they do confuse!
Sorry, my math vibes are low today. Try tomorrow.'
I’m a calculator, not a superhero!
